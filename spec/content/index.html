<h1>CMS Data Element Library - FHIR Implementation Guide</h1>

<p>
    In 2014, the Social Security Act was amended to include the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation
    (IMPACT) Act, which required the standardization and interoperability of patient assessment in specific categories
    for post-acute care (PAC) settings, including long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), home health agencies (HHAs), skilled
    nursing facilities (SNFs), and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). It focuses on standardizing data elements
    in specified quality measure domains and patient assessment domains for cross setting comparison and clinical
    information exchange, respectively
</p>

<p>
    The CMS Data Element Library (DEL) supports the IMPACT Act requirements by serving as the centralized repository for
    CMS PAC assessment data elements and their associated health information technology (IT) standards to promote
    interoperability of patient data.
</p>

<p>
    This implementation guide defines a way to store, retrieve, and use DEL data through a FHIR API. As the PAC
    assessments are updated on a regular basis, a DEL FHIR API can ensure EHRs have access to the most current data
    sets.
</p>

<h1>Data Mapping</h1>

<p>
    The data mapping describes how all the fields in the DEL database map to fields in FHIR resources.
    This is a technical document that can be helpful when trying to figure out exactly how data is populated in FHIR
    resources.

<h1>Developers Guide</h1>

<p>
    The developers guide is intended to provide guidance to software developers who want to use the data in the DEL FHIR
    server. Use this guide if you want to build software that depends on the DEL FHIR server.
