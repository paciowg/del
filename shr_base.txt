// Defining Entry to keep the shr-cli tooling happy (generates a warning if missing)
Element: Entry
Concept: MTH#C1705654
Description: "Metadata attributes that apply to any item represented in the standard health record. An Entry may not belong exclusively to a single person's health record, but could represent an entity that surfaces in multiple records, such as organizations or practitioners. If the entry belongs to a single person's record, then the identity of the person of record must be recorded."
1..1 EntryId
1..* EntryType

  Element: EntryId
  Concept: MTH#C0600091
  Description: "A persistent, permanent identifier for an entry in a health record, unique within the scope of the health record."
  Value: id

  Element: EntryType  // Would EntryClass be clearer?
  Concept: TBD
  Description: "SHR data element identifier, as a URI. The EntryType array includes the entire 'based on' hierarchy to enable searching for classes of things, for example, searching for all vital signs, or all types of behavioral observations."
  Value: uri

EntryElement: Observation
Concept: MTH#C1554188
Description: "Base class for observations (measurements, tests, or questions) and a value containing the result (answer). The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments."
Value: 0..1 (CodeableConcept or boolean or dateTime or string)
1..1 ObservationCode
1..1 Subject

  Element: ObservationCode
  Concept: MTH#C1706203
  Description: "A code that represents what the finding concerns, for example, the subject's height, blood pressure, disease status, wound dimensions, diabetes risk, etc. Although named ObservationCode, in different contexts the same attribute might be more naturally referred to as a property, observable, or test code. In assertions (observations without an explicit question), the observation code is defaulted to a value representing 'assertion'."
  Value: CodeableConcept

  Element: Subject
  Concept: TBD
  Description: "The person or thing that this entry relates to, usually the Person of Record. However, not all entries have health information specifically about the patient, but in different contexts, could refer to a fetus, family member (living or dead), device, location, organization, finding, condition, or intervention."
  Value: ref(Patient)

EntryElement: Goal
Concept: TBD
Description: "Base class for goals (outcomes, objectives, functional capabilities)"
Value: 0..1 CodeableConcept
1..1 GoalCode
1..1 Subject

  Element: GoalCode
